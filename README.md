# Game Recorder
### NOTE: This was an assignment for Champlain College so a starting codebase was given to students. Most of the student work was done in the GamePlayer and GameRecorder files.
Records input from the player and can replay moves through a circular queue and binary saving/loading. This is a basic form of replaying moves from the player, sort of like the replay feature you find in Super Meat-Boy. Press R to start recording and S to stop recording. Press P to start playback and E to end playback.
